<<SPELLING GAMES WITH MATCHING IMAGES/MATH>>

SECTION A - IDEAS
-----------------

* users  (login options or guest session)
    - login option is only for admin use
    - guest session is for every user with a name

* admin ( to generate game content and load it into database)
    - a content includes a question, image, answer and difficulty level
    - ability to modify/delete an existing content
    - ability to add a new content


* remember where the user left off
    - record the question id and the user's answer
    - when the user logs back in, the new content will be rendered
    - show the number of correct/incorrect answers
    - user can go back to any previous question to redo his/her work


SECTION  B - GAMES RULES
------------------------

*  SPELLING
    - provide an image, the name of it and difficulty level to build questions pool
    - difficulty level of a question is from 1 to 9, where 9 is the hardest
    - screen will show the image and list of possible letters to form the corresponding name
    - players shall pick correct letter to form a correct word which matches the image
    - if a question of difficult level alpha is answered correctly, the next question
      will have a difficult level of > alpha
    - if the questions pool is out of 'num' level question, look for 'num' - 1 un-answered questions


* MATH

 (addition, subtraction only with number range from 0 - 10, apply only 2 numbers)

    - provide a number --> generate an image (sticks) to represent that number
    - provide a list of answers which have exactly one correct one
    - provide a difficulty level of the question
